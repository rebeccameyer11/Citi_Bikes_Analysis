# Citi Bikes Analysis

## Project Summary
For this project, the goal was to analyze user behavior to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city, while also identify expansion opportunities. 

## Key Questions
<ul>
    <li>What are the most popular stations in the city?</li>
    <li>Which are the months with the most trips taken? Is there a weather component at play? How does temperature affect ridership numbers?</li>
    <li>What are the most popular trips between stations?</li>
    <li>Are the existing stations evenly distributed?</li>
    <li>How does weekday vs. weekend ridership differ?</li>
    <li>Are electric bikes more popular than classic bikes? </li>
</ul>
